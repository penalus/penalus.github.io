    <h1>My First Time Using HTML/CSS!</h1>
    <p>Im 28 year old girl from Norway and I just started coding. I am starting out with HTML and CSS courses from
	<a href="https://codeacademy.com">CodeAcademy</a>, and I <em>love</em> it. I have always been interested and good at web 
	site making but this is my very first time writing code from scratch. As I get better, I will add more stuff to 
	this "resume". Stay tuned for my progress.</p>
